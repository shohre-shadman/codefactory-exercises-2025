            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <hr><ul> 
                <li>3 egg whites</li>
                <li>1 pinch salt</li>
                <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>

             </ul>
             <h3>Directions</h3>
             <hr><ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a
                    sheet pan with parchment paper. Draw a 9 inch circle on the
                    parchment. An easy way to do this is to draw around the
                    outside of a 9 inch pan with a pencil.</li>
                <li>"In a large bowl, beat egg whites on high speed until soft peaks
                    form. Add 3/4 cup of the sugar gradually, while continuing to
                    whip. Make sure sugar is completely dissolved. Mix together the
                    remaining 1/4 cup sugar with the cornstarch; lightly fold into
                    meringue with lemon juice.</li>   
                <li>Spread a layer of meringue to fit a circle on parchment,
                    approximately 1/4 inch thick. With the remainder of mixture, a
                    pipe or spoon swirls around the edges to form a shallow bowl
                    shape.</li>    
                <li>In a large bowl, combine the cream and half a cup of
                    confectioners sugar, and whip until thickened. Decorate with
                    fruit of your choice; strawberries are excellent.</li>    
                </ol>
