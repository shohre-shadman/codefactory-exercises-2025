            A Little About Me
        </h2>
        <p>
            I’m currently learning to be a full-stack developer with a focus on both front-end and back-end technologies. I’ve always been fascinated by how websites and applications work, and I decided to take the leap into coding. So far, I’ve worked with technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and MongoDB. As I continue learning, I aim to build projects that challenge me and expand my skill set. I’m passionate about building intuitive, efficient, and scalable web applications

        </p>
        <h2>
            What I Do
        </h2>
        <p>
            As a <strong>full-stack development student</strong>, I’m diving deep into both front-end and back-end development. On the front-end, I focus on creating responsive, user-friendly interfaces using tools like React and JavaScript. On the back-end, I’m learning server-side development with Node.js, Express, and working with databases like MongoDB and PostgreSQL. I’m currently working on personal projects that demonstrate these skills. Feel free to explore my work and see how I’m progressing!
        </p>
        <h2>
            Outside of Code
        </h2>
        <p>
            When I’m not coding, I enjoy [list a couple of hobbies, like reading, playing video games, or hiking]. These activities give me a chance to unwind and bring new perspectives to my development work. I also love staying up to date with the latest tech trends and diving into new technologies—whether that’s learning about new frameworks or exploring design patterns.
        </p>
        <h2>
